    <h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Effective date: September 17, 2025</p>

    <p>Accessio ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. This is a simple, plain-language summary — not legal advice.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal information:</strong> when you register or contact us we may collect your name, email address, and other information you provide.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> information about how you use the site (pages visited, timestamps, device/browser information, IP address) collected automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> to enable features, remember preferences, and analyze site usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain our services (accounts, reservations, gate pass requests, locker rentals).</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your account, updates, and support.</li>
        <li>To analyze and improve the site, and to detect and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">3. Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share data with trusted service providers that perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, email delivery). These providers are contractually required to protect your information.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">5. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can review and update your account information by signing in to your account.</li>
        <li>You can opt out of non-essential communications by using the unsubscribe link in emails.</li>
        <li>You can control cookies via your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect site functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information. No system is fully secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">7. Children</h2>
    <p>Our services are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. If we make material changes we'll post the new policy and update the effective date.</p>
